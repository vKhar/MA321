    "\n",
    "These are basic programming constructs that we need to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sequence,\n",
    "- Assignment,\n",
    "- Selection,\n",
    "- Iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the Assignment and Selection Construct in the sections below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.0 Programming Construct : Sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "The most general construct of programming corresponds to the sequence of instructions, or more specifically, the sequence of statements that are specified within the program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1 Programming Construct : Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to process data, we typically need to store it in computer memory. This is done via the use of variables. You might be familiar with variables given their use in mathematics. However, variables in mathematics and computing are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, a variable corresponds to an identifier that references a unit of data in computer memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define a variable, we must utilise the first programming construct: an **assignment statement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how assignment and variables work, let us refer to the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```text\n",
    ">#x is the variable, 100 is the data, ← is the assignment operator\n",
    ">#and the whole line below is the assignment statement\n",
    ">x ← 100\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is a typical assignment statement. We are specifying a variable, i.e., an identifier `x`, which will reference some part of the computer’s memory, and in that segment of computer memory, store the integer value `100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the assignment statement does 3 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stores the variable identifier in an identifier table\n",
    "2. Allocates computer memory for the storage of the data type value specified; the memory allocated will correspond to some specific location in memory - i.e., a memory address\n",
    "3. Links the variable identifier to the computer memory location\n",
    "\n",
    "In this manner, whenever the variable is used, the computer knows that we are referring to the value that is stored in the associated location in computer memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment also allows programmers to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign new values to a variable\n",
    "2. Copy variable values\n",
    "3. Swap values between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It should also be noted that when assigning a value, that value may be computed using expressions consisting of arithmetic, logical, comparison and/or string operations. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">x ← 10 + 20\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such expressions can, and or course, often do include the specification of other variables. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">result ← a*x**2 + b*x + c\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the assignment operator is `=` , which should not be confused with the equal sign $=$ from mathematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we can do multivariable assignment in a single line too. Example:\n",
    ">```python\n",
    "> a,b = 10, 20\n",
    ">```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables must be **initialised** (i.e. assigned with a value) before use.\n",
    "\n",
    "User can define variable names on their own. However, there are certain restrictions.\n",
    "1. variable name can **only** contain following characters:\n",
    "    * letters either in lowercase (`a` to `z`) or uppercase (`A` to `Z`)\n",
    "    * digits (`0` to `9`)\n",
    "    * underscore (`_`)\n",
    "2. variable name **cannot** begin with digits.\n",
    "3. Python **keywords** are reserved thus shall not be used. (See below)\n",
    "4. Do not use double-underscores `__` as the leading and trailing character in an identifier (Python built-in types already use this notation).\n",
    "5. Use underscore `_` to join multiple words to form a sensible name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we are concerned only with numeric and alphabetical values. Declaring integer values in Python is quite straightforward, you just type the character keys on your keyboard. However, the alphabetical values, termed **strings** in Python are declared by enclosing the alphabets or characters within single quotation marks `''` or `\"\"`."
